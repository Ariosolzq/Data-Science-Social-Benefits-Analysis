## **2. Assumptions & Focus Selection**
### **2.1 General Assumptions**
📝 **Hypothesis:**  
- We hypothesize that **social welfare programs deliver the highest SROI**.
- **Health programs**, especially Medicaid, have a **significant impact** on healthcare access & medical debt reduction.

📌 **Reasoning:**  
- Medicaid **reduces poverty, improves access**, and promotes **equity**.  
- Studies indicate that **social welfare investments (healthcare, education, poverty alleviation) yield high societal returns**.

### **2.2 Focus on Health Programs**
✔ **High Social & Economic Relevance:** Addresses access to care, medical debt reduction & health equity.  
✔ **Significant Budget Share:** Medicaid is a major federal expenditure.  
✔ **Proven Benefits:** Medicaid expansion **reduces the uninsured rate** & improves health outcomes.

### **2.3 Why Medicaid?**
✔ **Directly impacts:**  
  - 🏥 **Children** – Preventive care, vaccinations  
  - 👵 **Elderly** – Nursing home & long-term care  
  - 🤰 **Pregnant Women** – Prenatal & postpartum care  
  - ♿ **Disabled Individuals** – Specialized treatments  

✔ **Policy Relevance:** **Should Medicaid funding be expanded for its social impact?** 🤔

## **4. Medicaid SROI Calculation**
### **4.1 Data Inputs**
| **Social Benefit Category**                     | **Amount (Billion $/year)** |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 📉 **Medical Debt Reduction**                 | $63B                   |
| 🏥 **Chronic Disease Cost Savings**           | $165B                  |
| 💼 **Increased Workforce Productivity**       | $250B                  |
| 🍼 **Infant Mortality Reduction & Future GDP** | $40B                   |
| **Total Benefits**                            | **$518 billion/year**   |

### **4.2 SROI Calculation**
📌 **Formula:**  
```math
SROI = \frac{\text{Total Social Benefits}}{\text{Medicaid Expenditure}}
```
📌 **Calculation:**  
```math
SROI = \frac{518}{965.8} \approx 0.536
```

### **4.3 Interpretation**
✔ **Every $1 spent on Medicaid generates $0.54** in measurable **social and economic benefits**.  
✔ **While the SROI is below 1**, Medicaid delivers critical societal returns such as:  
   📉 **Lower medical debt**  
   🏥 **Improved health outcomes**  
   💼 **Higher workforce productivity**  
✔ **Other programs (e.g., education) may yield a higher SROI, but Medicaid ensures essential healthcare access**.
