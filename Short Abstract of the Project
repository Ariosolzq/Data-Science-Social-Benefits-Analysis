### 🛠 **Project Title: Social Impact of Federal Programs – Medicaid SROI Analysis**  

This project analyzes the **Social Return on Investment (SROI) of Medicaid**, assessing its **economic, social, and healthcare impacts**. By leveraging **data-driven analysis**, we compare Medicaid’s SROI against other major federal programs like **education and transportation**.  

### **🔍 Key Objectives:**

### **📊 Methodology:**  
🔹 **Data Collection** – Gathering **federal spending data, health statistics, and socioeconomic indicators** from sources like **USAspending.gov and Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF)**.  
🔹 **Quantitative Analysis** – Applying the **SROI formula** to evaluate Medicaid’s cost-effectiveness in delivering **public benefits**.  
🔹 **Comparative Insights** – Benchmarking Medicaid against **other programs** to assess its relative impact.  

This project aims to **support evidence-based policy decisions** by providing actionable insights into the **social impact of government spending**. 🚀
